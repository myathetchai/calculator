# Simple calculator web application


## Trying out the application

In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode

###  `cd backend ` then  `node server.js`
This starts the simple REST API server that performs the calculations

To test the REST API functions, run `npx jest test.js`
2 simple functions have been made to test the addition and subtraction POST requests respectively
### `npm test`

2 basic unit tests have been completed, one to test for rendering of the web app page, and the other to test for the pressing of the "Add" button and the calling of the function that sends the POST request
